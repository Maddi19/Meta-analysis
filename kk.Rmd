**ABSTRACT**

Animal pollination stands as a crucial ecosystem service, yet the diversity of pollinator species is declining due to multifaceted factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and intensified agriculture. This decline poses a threat to the reproductive success of numerous plants. While pioneer studies have often explored an extreme scenario of complete pollinator community disappearance, a more realistic approximation examining the repercussions of decreasing pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success is needed. We conducted a comprehensive global meta-analysis to unveil a substantial and adverse impact of diminishing pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success. Our results indicate varying magnitudes of this effect across plant families, affecting both self-incompatible and self-compatible species. We reveal a greater negative consequences on the reproductive success of wild plants compared to crops and reducing wild pollinator species diversity has more pronounced effects than reducing managed species diversity. Intriguingly, the loss of invertebrate, nocturnal, and wild pollinators manifests a more significant impact than the loss of vertebrates, diurnal, or managed pollinators. In conclusion, our findings consistently underscore the positive role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, emphasizing the urgency of mitigating factors leading to the decline in pollinator species diversity.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Animal-mediated pollination is a critical ecosystem service, with plant species ranging from those heavily dependent on cross-pollination, to self-pollinating ones [@aguilar2006]. Indeed, estimates suggest that \~88% of the world´s flowering plant species [@ollerton2011], and 75% of the major crop species benefit to some degree from animal pollination [@klein2006]. Aside from their importance as crops, plants that depend on animal pollination are also valuable as sources of medicine, fodder for livestock, or construction materials [@ratto2018], and play vital roles in the maintenance of the diversity [@cardinale2012] and stability of natural ecosystems[@cardinale2004].

Despite pollinator importance, factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and agricultural intensification have contributed to the decline of many pollinator populations [@junqueira2021; @potts2010; @ghazoul2005; @reverté2023; @powney2019]. In response to these concerning declines, there has been a surge in scientific studies investigating the consequences of pollinator decline for ecosystem functioning [@gazzea2023; @dainese2019; @klein2003; @klein2006]. However, classic plant pollination studies have adopted a pragmatic all-or-nothing approach, comparing the fitness of plants open to pollinator visitation to those where pollinator visits are intentionally prevented [@gazzea2023]. While this research indicates that the complete loss of pollinator populations detrimentally impacts plant reproductive success [@fontaine2005; @gazzea2023], a complete removal scenario is often unrealistic. Certainly, although the abundance or diversity of some pollinator species has declined in many ecosystems[@powney2019], other pollinator populations not only survive but thrive in these altered environments [@winfree2009]. Thus, a complete loss of pollinators is unlikely, and a more realistic scenario is one where pollinator species diversity declines.

Focusing on pollinator species diversity and its role in plant reproductive success also provides an opportunity to understand biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships [@cardinale2012] beyond experimental conditions and for functions involving several trophic levels[@tilman2014]. Explorations of this topic have found mixed support for the role of species complementarity [@winfree2018; @kleijn2015] versus species selection effects[@fargione2007] on plant reproductive success. Other system-specific mechanisms such as the role of behavioural interferences among species  have been observed ; for instance, managed honey bees show increased pollination efficiency in the presence of wild bees [@greenleaf2006].

There is scattered evidence on the pollinator diversity-ecosystem functioning relationship [@garibaldi2013; @kleijn2015], but, the predominant focus has been on managed pollinators, particularly in agriculture [@kleijn2015]. Moreover, the different approaches used, including experimental and observational approaches, makes the mixed results observed difficult to interpret. The next phase entails revealing the universality of the relationship between pollinator species diversity and plant reproductive success across diverse geographical areas, involving not just agricultural crops but also wild plant species.

Here, we conduct a meta-analysis to understand the impact of decreasing pollinator species diversity for plant reproductive success. To do this, we use data extracted from 200 studies across the globe which use diverse study designs, ranging from experiments excluding or adding pollinator species, to observations across gradients of pollinator species diversity. First, we assess the overall effect of reducing pollinator species diversity on plant fitness and then focus on understanding the drivers of the observed relationships. Using multilevel meta-analytical models, we addressed these following fundamental questions: (i) How strong is the overall effect of reduced pollinator diversity on plant reproductive success? (ii) Does this effect vary between crops and wild plants, or in different climatic zones? (iii) Does the effect vary according to reproductive success measures, the compatibility of the plant or the type of pollinator excluded?

### RESULTS

#### Literature search

We performed our analysis using 751 effect sizes extracted from 200 studies. Our dataset included observations across 44 countries (Fig.1), where 18.88% of the studies were located in Central Europe (33 observations), followed by the USA (24), South Africa (19), Brazil (15), Mexico (14) and Australia (12) (Fig. 2A). Regarding the number of observations, 15.1% were done in Mexico (117), followed by the USA where 10.18% of the observations were done (Fig. 2A). Studies were published between 1976 and 2022, with the number of publications increasing over time (Fig. 2B) reflecting that it was not until the 1990s that this issue began to be studied more closely.

**Figure 1**. **Geographical distribution of the observations.** For each included country, the map includes the total number of observations and the proportion of observations in crops (green) or other areas (purple).

The most frequently studied habitat type was agricultural landscape (245 observations), followed by shrubland (198) and forest (151), with dunes, savannahs, and marshes being the least studied (Fig. 2C). Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests were by far the most studied biomes (178 observations), followed by tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (120 observations) and deserts and xeric shrublands (116). Meanwhile, temperate conifer forests (1), mangroves (1), and tundra (3) were the least studied ones (Fig. 2D). The data analysed in these studies encompass 220 plant species from 65 families. Cactaceae (143 observations) and Ericaceae (95) are by far the most studied plant families, accounting for 19% and 12.6% respectively of all observations. The Fabaceae and Rosaceae plant families account for 10% and 7.7% of all observations, respectively with 75 and 58 observations (Fig. 2E). Hence, data may be skewed towards well studied habitats and plant families. 81.3% of these observations were from field exclusion experiments, as observational studies are less common with the 8% of the observations (Fig. 2F).

#### Impacts of decreasing pollinator species diversity

First, we tested the overall effect of losing pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success. Using the 751 observations, our model showed that a loss in pollinator diversity had a large overall negative effect on plant reproductive success (Hedges´g =-0.82, 95% confidence intervals, CI=-0.99 : -0.65; p\<0.0001, Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S3). There was significant between-study heterogeneity (Q = 32822, p-value = \<0.0001) and the proportion of this heterogeneity that was due between-study differences was high (I^2^ = 96.94%). EXPLICAR QUE SIGNIFICA ESTO.Loss of pollinator diversity had a negative effect on plant reproductive success for both wild plants and crops. The effect was slightly larger for wild plant species(Fig. 3B; Hedges´g estimate wild plants= -0.89 and Hedges´g estimate for crops=-0.64; LRT p=0.05; marginal R^2^=0.02).

Smaller, semi-transparent points represent individual comparisons. Differences in their size refer to the weight they supply to the analysis. The vertical dashed line represents where the effect size is equal to zero (i.e. where there is no difference between control and treatment groups). *k* indicates the number of comparisons and in parentheses is the number of studies from which they are derived. Precision indicates the weight of each study, being studies with lowest SE more precise and therefore with bigger precision circles (1/SE).

The effect of diversity loss was different for different metrics of plant reproductive success (LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^=0.1) with the greatest negative effect observed for fruit set, followed by fruit weight, and the number of seeds per fruit (Fig. 5A). This pattern was consistent across all habitats and climates studied (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Fig. 4). In fact, no evidence was found suggesting that the loss of pollinator species diversity had a greater impact in any specific climatic zone (LRT p=0.92; marginal R^2^=0.005) or habitat type (LRT p=0.51; marginal R^2^ =0.04). In terms of the type of study, the largest estimate was observed in mesocosm studies (Hedges´g estimate=-1.11), while exclusions and observational studies had the same estimate (Hedges´g estimates= -0.79, Supplementary Fig. S6). However, these differences between study types were not statistically significant (LRT p=0.42; marginal R^2^=0.013), and the large confidence interval of the mesocosm studies is noteworthy (CI=-1.58 : -0.64). Three of the five observations with the greatest negative impact on plant reproductive success occurred in experimental mesocosms where different species were introduced within boxes or meshes.

**Figure 4. Effect of pollinator diversity loss on different climatic zones**. To compare climate zones, we grouped those corresponding to temperate zones, such as mixed forests, grasslands and coniferous forests, and did the same for tropical zones, including subtropical zones. We also grouped less studied zones together as the 'other' category, which includes mangroves, tundra, marshes, and high mountains. Large points refer to the summary effect size, thicker bars around them represent the 95% confidence intervals, and the thinner bars the 95% prediction intervals. Smaller, semi-transparent points represent individual comparisons. Differences in their size refer to the weight they supply to the analysis. The vertical dashed line represents where the effect size is equal to zero (i.e. where there is no difference between control and treatment groups). *k* indicates the number of comparisons and in parentheses is the number of studies from which they are derived. Precision indicates the weight of each study, being studies with lowest SE more precise and therefore with bigger precision circles (1/SE).

As expected, we observed differences in the effect of pollinator species loss across plant families (LRT p\<0.0001, marginal R^2^=0.18). The families most affected by the loss of pollinators were Melastomaceae, Lamiaceae, Xanthorrhoeaceae, Theaceae, and Araliaceae, while the least affected were Actinidiaceae, Stachyuraceae, Heliconiaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, and Campanulaceae (Supplementary Fig. S7). From the information extracted on reproductive compatibility for 85 of the 225 plant species in our dataset, our results show that the loss of pollinator species diversity affects not only self-incompatible plant species (Hedges´g estimate -1.05) but couterintuitively, also self-compatible ones (Hedges´g estimate -0.69) (Fig. 5B). To understand this pattern, we further assessed whether all measures of plant reproductive success were equally affected for self-compatible plant species and found that in this case, a decrease in pollinator species diversity led to larger negative effects for seed set (Hedges´g estimate -1.13), followed by fruit weight (Hedges´g estimate -1.01) and finally fruit set (Hedges´g estimate -0.95), although differences were not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Smaller, semi-transparent points represent individual comparisons. Differences in their size refer to the weight they supply to the analysis. The vertical dashed line represents where the effect size is equal to zero (i.e. where there is no difference between control and treatment groups). *k* indicates the number of comparisons and in parentheses is the number of studies from which they are derived. Precision indicates the weight of each study, being studies with lowest SE more precise and therefore with bigger precision circles (1/SE).

Our results show that there were more pronounced negative effects when invertebrate species (Hedges´g=-1.37; CI=-1.55 : -1.01) were lost compared to cases when vertebrate species were lost (Hedges´g=-0.52; CI=-0.73 : -0.19) (LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^=0.12) (Fig. 6A). Studies that focused on declines in invertebrate pollinators included a wide variety of taxonomic groups, such as bees, bumblebees, flies, syrphid flies, ants, or beetles, while those that focused on vertebrate pollinator species, primarily examined losses of bat and bird species, and to a smaller extent on rodents, small marsupials, monkeys, or lizards.

In contrast, when examining observations that exclude diurnal or nocturnal animals, which in most cases involve vertebrate species such as bats and hummingbirds, our results show that the exclusion of nocturnal animals had a greater negative impact (Hedges´g= -1.31, CI=-1.61 : -1.02) on the reproductive success of plants than the exclusion of diurnal animals (Hedges´g= -0.66, CI=-0.95 : -0.37, Fig. 6B) (LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^= 0.08).

To reconcile the above results, we identified potential biases in the plant families studied for diurnal and nocturnal pollinators
(Supplementary Fig. S9). We show that diurnal vertebrate pollinators include birds and hummingbirds (some lizards and mammals) and use a wide range of plant families, whereas studies of nocturnal vertebrate pollinators include mostly
bats, and focused mainly on cacti. There is also a bias in the studies of both vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators. The plant families most extensively studied in the case of vertebrates are Cactaceae and Ericaceae. In the case of
invertebrates, a greater diversity of plant families has been studied, with the Fabaceae and Rosaceae being the most important in addition to the previously mentioned families.

Finally, we found that the loss of wild pollinator species had a greater negative impact on plant reproductive success (Hedges´g estimate -0.8, CI= -0.96 : -0.64) compared to the loss of managed species (Hedges´g estimate -0.27, CI= -0.47 : -0.06, Fig. 6C) (LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^= 0.04). Note that studies on managed pollinators have focused on a much smaller range of plant families compared to those on wild pollinators. Among the families studied, Rosaceae has been the most studied (Supplementary Fig. S9).

### DISCUSSION

This meta-analysis provides robust evidence that a decrease in pollinator species diversity has a generalized large negative impact for plant reproductive success, including both crop and wild plant species. These findings represent a robust quantitative review linking pollinator species diversity with the reproductive success of both cultivated and wild plants at a global scale. As pollinator species diversity is expected to decline further in some areas [@potts2010, @reverté2023], which would significantly affect the reproduction of various plant species.

By focusing on reductions in pollinator diversity we show that the consequences of pollinator declines are noticeable beyond a total pollinator exclusion, allowing for more realistic estimates of the consequences of pollinator declines. While a large number of studies have shown that the maintenance of optimal pollination services is critical in order to achieve high and stable crop yields [@gazzea2023, @garibaldi2013, @woodcock2019, @bishop2021], our results show that the impact of reduced pollinator species diversity had even a more negative effect on wild plants than on crops. This could be attributed to the cultivation of crop varieties that are less dependent on pollinators[@marini2015] or to the different inputs used within agricultural systems which lead to lower resource limitation within cultivated plant species [@garibaldi2011, @marini2015].

Furthermore, we observed that all measures of plant reproductive success were negatively affected by the loss of pollinator diversity, including fruit set, seed set and fruit weight. As flowers depend on conspecific pollen to reach their stigmas for fruit and seed production [@johnson2023], and given the vital role of pollinators in facilitating this transfer, we might expect both fruit set and seed set to be significantly impacted by decreasing pollinator species diversity. However, while we might expect that, in response to producing fewer fruits, plants would allocate more resources to yield larger and heavier fruits [@fang2006], our findings indicate that the weight of individual fruits is also reduced by the decline in pollinator species diversity. Only nine of the studies selected provided information on both fruit weight and fruit set, and thus, it is unclear whether plants that produce fewer fruits also produce lighter fruits. Amongst these nine studies we found that in five of them, fruit weight was much less affected than fruit set, in two studies there were no differences between the two measures, in one study fruit weight was more affected than fruit set, and finally, in the last one there were no negative effects of reducing pollinator diversity for both measures.

In the case of self-compatible plants, we expected no or small effects of losing pollinator species diversity given their selfing abilities and the absence of mechanisms to prevent selfing [@sáez2022]. However, we detected decreasing values of seed set, fruit weight and fruit set for self-compatible species, probably driven by a reduction in pollen quality when less pollinators are involved, which tends to result in smaller and lighter fruits [@wietzke2018]. This may be due to the negative impact of increased pollen transfer from the same plant individual, which is genetically identical, and can lead to the abortion of selfed zygotes [@owen2007]and therefore, to reduced seed set[@chacoff2008]. Pollinator diversity can affect the fruit quality of compatible plants through different mechanisms leading to efficient cross-pollination, as has been observed for self-pollinated strawberries, for example [@wietzke2018]. In any case, self-compatibility is a continuous trait that can vary even among populations of the same plant species [@baker1959; @razanajatovo2016], but being self-compatible does not preclude that the presence of flower visitors is positive. The combination of outcrossing and self-pollination in these species serves as a reproductive safeguard, ensuring that self-pollination occurs only in cases where pollinators have failed to transfer pollen [@suetsugu2014].

The negative impacts of pollinator diversity loss on plant reproductive success were found to be consistent across landscapes and biomes. This is consistent with the findings of Gazzea et al., [@gazzea2023], who studied cultivated plants and did not observe any climate-related effects on the impact of pollinator diversity loss. However, we found no differences between biomes when observing only vertebrate pollinators, in contrast to previous findings[@ratto2018] showing more negative effects in the tropics when losing vertebrate pollinators.

This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that nocturnal vertebrate pollinators have a greater impact on plant reproductive success than diurnal vertebrate pollinators. This finding is consistent with a previous meta-analysis on vertebrate pollinators[@ratto2018] where they found that bat-pollinated plants are more severely affected by pollinator loss than bird- or rodent-pollinated plants. Many bat-pollinated plants produce very large amounts of pollen, and at similar flower visitation rates bats can transfer up to four times as much pollen relative to that transferred by birds, making bats more effective than birds at transferring pollen between flowers [@muchhala2007].

Our results further show the impact of losing invertebrate pollinators was larger than that of losing vertebrate pollinators. This result emphasizes the significance of invertebrates and their role in pollination. Despite their importance, estimates of existing invertebrate pollinators are missing, but for insects in general, there are estimated to be between 6.7 and 7.3 million species, with only 1 million species described and 80% remaining to be discovered and their ecology described [@stork2018, @reverté2023]. However, it is important to note that the effect of each type of pollinator on the reproductive success of plants is dependent on the plant family being studied, a bias which is beyond our control. For example, in our dataset the impact of nocturnal vertebrate pollinators has been extensively researched in cacti, more so than any other plant family, and it is in this family in particular where nocturnal pollinators play a significant role [@munguía-rosas2009]. However, it is not possible to make generalizations beyond this family of plants.

Our results demonstrate that the loss of wild pollinator diversity has a greater impact than the loss of one or two species of managed pollinators, despite their disproportionate abundance (with honeybee colonies for example hosting 60-80,000 individuals) as compared to wild pollinator species (mostly solitary bees). This suggests that beyond pollinator abundances and visit numbers, the diversity and complementarity in pollination services that a diverse wild pollinator community can provide has a greater effect on plant reproductive success. Currently, European honeybees, *Apis mellifera*, are the most important pollinators for crops worldwide, particularly for mass-flowering crops [@magrach2017, @kleijn2015, @mallinger2014]. Yet, while wild pollinators can provide complementary pollination services to plants by collecting pollen and depositing it in stigma surface in different ways [@johnson2023], showing different phenologies [@bartomeus2011, @bartomeus2013] and overall behaviours [@mallinger2014], mismatches can occur when honeybees with their generalist foraging behaviour, are less effective in pollinating some plants, leading to reduced reproductive success [@magrach2017].

Indeed, in some cases, due to an excess of pollen in the stigmas brought by subsequent honeybee visits can prevent pollen tube development [@sáez2014], given the existence of a generally saturating relationship between pollinator visitation rate and fruit set [@sáez2014, @morris2010]. Since various pollinator species may carry pollen from different plant species on different parts of their bodies [@johnson2023], the likelihood of stigmas collapsing is reduced when pollinator diversity is high. In addition, managed species, such as honeybees, tend to visit more flowers on an individual plant before moving on to the next one, in comparison to native insect visitors [@travis2023, @magrach2017]. This behaviour increases the transfer of self-pollen and inbreeding pressure[@travis2023], with the consequence that early acting inbreeding depression lowers seed set [@chacoff2008]. Moreover, a greater diversity of wild pollinators may provide redundancy, which can contribute to stability in the face of climatic or human-induced disturbances [@mallinger2014, @bartomeus2013, @winfree2008]. In a recent meta-analysis on the efficiency of honeybees in crops [@sáez2022], they found that honeybees reduce pollination limitation in self-incompatible crops, but not in self-compatible ones. Other research has shown that in self-compatible plants, offspring (SEED SET OR FRUIT SET BETTER) QUE MIDIERON? resulting from honey bee pollination exhibited similar fitness to that produced by self-pollination, but lower fitness than offspring resulting from native insect pollination [@travis2023].This finding highlights the significance of wild pollinators and underscores the importance of pollinator functional diversity for a plant reproductive success, and emphasizes, the potential risks of relying exclusively on honeybees or other managed, abundant species.

Our meta-analysis further underscores the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and extends current knowledge arising predominantly from experimental settings that link plant species diversity to biomass production [@cardinale2012] to real-world conditions and two trophic levels. Specifically, this research shows that the reproductive success of plants is positively correlated with the functional diversity of pollinators, as supported by smaller experimental studies [@fontaine2005,@albrecht2012] and observational studies [@hoehn2008]. Functional diversity is widely acknowledged as the most important component of diversity [@hoehn2008], since diverse assemblages enhance niche complementarity [@cardinale2006a],[@hooper2005a]. Many studies have shown that reductions in the number of genes, species, and functional groups of organisms generally decrease the efficiency of whole communities in capturing biologically essential resources such as nutrients, water, light, and prey, and converting them into biomass [@cardinale2012]. A diverse assemblage of bee species can be characterized by particular functional traits that facilitate pollination services[@martins2015, @coux2016]. Our results suggest that pollinator complementarity probably plays a crucial role in the pollination process increasing the stability of ecosystem functions. Alternatively, a higher diversity could also favor selection effects, increasing the probability of hosting highly efficient species (e.g., [@schwartz2000]).

While our dataset, includes a fairly representative global coverage of studies it is still subject to a number of limitations. In particular, most studies only provided information on species diversity values and no information on species abundances or visitation rates, and thus we were not able to disentangle the effect of reducing species diversity with that of reducing abundance. In addition, it was not possible to measure and differentiate the magnitude of the decline in pollinator diversity between studies, as we cannot control for the extent of the decline in diversity because most of the articles are exclusion experiments where the number of excluded species is unknown. Therefore, we conclude that this needs to be considered in further research, although the diversity of study types in ecology complicates this.

In summary, our results demonstrate the importance of pollinator diversity for the reproductive success of plants worldwide, including both wild plants and crops. The implications of these results extend beyond individual species' fitness and crop species, potentially influencing community dynamics and ecosystem stability[@lanuza2018]. Our study underscores the urgency of implementing measures to mitigate pollinator diversity declines and emphasizes the need for tailored conservation efforts that should also consider the importance of a diverse pollinator community for the preservation of plant diversity.

### **METHODOLOGY**

#### **Data Collection**

We conducted a systematic literature search using Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases to identify journal articles that focused on the effect of pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success. Our search terms (pollinator\*  AND (abundance OR visit\* OR diversity OR effect) AND (fruit\* set OR seed\* set OR "pollination success" OR "plant\* reproduct\*" OR "plant\* fitness")) returned a total of 6,747 papers published until October 2022. We removed duplicate records as well as those that could not be accessed or interpreted.

To ensure reproducibility, we reported detailed information of the literature searches as a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [@page2021; @haddaway2022]in Supplementary Fig.S1.

**Literature Selection Process**

First, we screened publications for inclusion based on their titles and abstracts using the R package "metagear" [@metagear]. We included articles according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) We further narrowed our results to only include those that actually measured the effect of pollinator diversity, removing other types of articles such as reviews or perspectives; (2) studies that compared open pollination versus totally excluded plants were not included;(3) studies where only the R^2^ was reported, without the deviance, were excluded; (4) effect sizes without variance were excluded. Moreover, studies were included if they fullfilled the following relevance criteria [@handbook2013]: Population or subject of study: any plant species of any part of the world; Intervention or Treatment: any pollinator species/taxon diversity reduction; Outcome or response: pllant reproductive success measures; Type of study: studies that correlate the subject with the intervention or that compare them in different situation/treatments (different pollinator diversity situations).

Following this, for the studies that we retained at the tile/abstract screening stage, we screened the full text of the articles following the application of inclusion criteria. At the end of the screening process, a total of 200 studies were selected for data extraction.

**Data Extraction and Effect Size Calculation**

We obtained the following data from text, supporting information, tables and figures from the selected studies: mean, standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), sample size (N), Student´s t, Fisher´s F, X2 values and Z scores. Where results were presented graphically, we extracted the mean and variation (e.g. SD , SE) from the figures using Engauge Digitizer. To impute the SD in cases where there were no data for SD or SE, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for the observations that reported them, and median CV. This was achieved using the following formula: CV=SD/mean. We then calculated the SD by using the product of the CV median and the sample size. We did this because excluding studies with missing variability data can lead to biased estimations of effect sizes [@kambach2020].

In addition to data on pollination impacts, we extracted the following metadata from each of the retained publications: (1) country where the study was performed, (2) year of publication, (3) biome, (4) landscape type (with a total of eight habitat types: agricultural, forest, shrubland, savannah , grassland, urban, dune and marsh), (5) the measure of plant reproductive success recorded (fruit set, fruit weight, seed set, yield, seed weight), (6) the plant family and species, (7) whether the decrease in pollinator species diversity was due to a pollinator exclusion, gradient or addition, and (8) the type of pollinators excluded or added (vertebrates vs invertebrates, diurnal vs nocturnal, wild vs managed).

To estimate the effect sizes across all studies, we calculated Hedges´ g (REF) from the data we extracted using the R packages "metafor" [@viechtbauer2010,@metafor] and "esc" [@esc]. To calculate Hedges´ g, we used lower pollinator diversity treatments as treatment groups and higher pollinator diversity treatments as control groups, such that positive values of Hedges´ g indicated that lower pollinator diversity increased plant reproductive success, whereas negative values indicated the opposite that reductions in pollinator diversity reduced plant reproductive success. In total, we used a total of 751 observations of 200 studies in our meta-analytical models. To interpret Hedges´g values, we followed Cohen's guidelines, where values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are considered to be indicative of small, medium, and large effects respectively [@brydges2019].

#### Multilevel Meta-Analysis Models

For a single study we often calculated multiple different effect sizes. This occurred when, for example, studies reported multiple different metrics of plant reproductive success, observations across various plant species, or explored the impact of different pollinators. The grouping of effect sizes at various levels goes against the assumption of independence, influencing the overall meta-analytic estimates. To address this and explore the variation in effect sizes while considering the non-independence of observations, we employed multi-level meta-analytical models. These models, like linear mixed-effects models, accommodate clustered effect sizes by incorporating random factors that account for nesting[@nakagawa2023].

To estimate the overall effect of the loss of pollinator diversity on plant reproductive success, we first built null models containing only the random effects. We tested these null models by combining the following terms as crossed or nested random terms: (1) publication unique identifier, (2) country where the study was carried out, (3) year of publication. We then evaluated the fit of the different random structures using Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Supplementary Table S1). The optimal random structure that was identified contained the unique publication identifier (Title) and the year of publication as crossed terms. Therefore, we built random effects meta-analytic models, where the study identity and the year of publication were included as random factors. We considered the overall effect size of higher pollinator diversity (without moderators) to be significantly different from zero if 95% of confidence intervals (CI) did not include zero.

Finally, as commonly occurs in meta-analysis, we lacked data for some moderator variables, and there were several incomplete combinations of moderator variables. As a result, we performed separate mixed-effects models for each moderator to investigate how these factors separately can modulate the effect size of losing pollinator diversity on the main plant reproductive success. The study employed various moderators, including measures of reproductive success, cultivars or no cultivars, study habitat and biome, plant genus and species compatibility, plant families, as well as the classification of lost pollinators according to their diurnal or nocturnal behavior, vertebrate or invertebrate status, and managed or wild classification. In order to assess the impact of losing these different pollinator types, we analysed different subsets of data that excluded either nocturnal or diurnal pollinators, vertebrates or invertebrates, and wild or managed pollinators. We built null models for each subset of excluded data and compared them with models that included moderators for the missing pollinator types.

The model coefficients and confidence intervals for each moderator level were then interpreted. We used a multilevel version of index, I^2^[@nakagawa2012] to quantify the total level of heterogeneity in our effect size ratios. We used marginal R2 to quantify how much heterogeneity is explained by different moderators [@nakagawa2012a].We fitted all the meta-analytic models with maximum likelihood (ML) for model comparisons with the null model, and re-ran with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to produce the model outputs that we report in the manuscript. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) was conducted to determine whether there were significant differences between the null model and the models with moderators. Significant differences indicate the presence of differences across the levels of the moderators [@bishop2022]. These analyses were executed using the *rma.mv* function in the R package "metafor" [@viechtbauer2010]. The overall mean effect with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and predicted intervals of the models were visualised as orchard plots, using the R package, orchaRd [@nakagawa2020, @orchaRd].

#### Publication Bias and Sensitivity Analysis

One form of publication bias termed the 'file-drawer problem' that can affect literature synthesis because studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published [@nakagawa2012].To explore the possibility of publication bias in our dataset, we used different procedures. First, we visualized them as a funnel plot graph (Supplementary Fig.S2). During this we detected 9 observations with a large effect size and low precision (high SE). This was due to the absence of small studies with limited effect sizes[@nakagawa2012]. Secondly, we used Kendall´s tau Rank correlation test to check for funnel plot asymmetry, and confirmed this (Kendall´s tau -0.2294, p\<0.0001). Thus, our dataset indicates a publication bias, with a greater number of studies exhibiting high standard errors and large negative effects compared to positive ones. Third, we checked for time lag bias by including publication year as a moderator in the models and we detected a positive trend over the years, with the effect becoming 0.02 less negative each year (Supplementary Fig.S3). Subsequently, we also performed the "trim and fill" method and it showed that there were no missing studies on the right side of the funnel plot. Finally, we calculated the Rosenberg´s weighted fail-safe number, which estimates the number of non-significant, unpublished studies that would be need in the meta-analysis to nullify the overall effect [@rosenberg2005]. The calculated weighted fail-safe number was 2 545 708, much larger than 5N+10 =3765 [@rosenberg2005], indicating the robustness of our results, regardless of some evidence of publication bias. undefined

Due to the potential connection between publication biases and outliers, we identified unreliable observations using Cook's distance [@läuter1985]. When Cook´s distance was higher than 4/n, where n is the number of observations [@altman2016a] we classified it as unreliable. We found 12 observations of 4 studies that showed high levels of influence. We compared the null models with and without these 12 outliers. As we observed that the estimates of the models were very similar (Supplementary Table S2), we continued our analysis with these 12 observations. When multiple effect sizes are extracted from primary studies, they can differ in strength (and even in direction) across studies, but also within studies [@nakagawa2023]. To capture this variance we conducted a sensitivity analysis by clustering the effect sizes at the individual study level to construct variance-covariance matrices, which resulted in the same qualitative overall effect (Supplementary Table S2). However, we found that aggregating the effect sizes at the individual study level led to a decrease in the overall estimate.

#### Plant Traits

In order to observe how phylogenetic traits associated with plant reproductive success might influence the observed effect size, we obtained data on plant species compatibility capacity from the TRY database[@kattge2011]. Furthermore, we also obtained this trait for some plant species not present in TRY from Lanuza et al., [@lanuza2023].
