**ABSTRACT**

Pollination is a crucial ecosystem service, yet pollinator species diversity is declining due to factors such as climate change, habitat loss, and agricultural intensification. While prior studies have often examined the extreme scenario of complete pollinator removal, showing negative impacts on plant reproductive success, we take a more realistic approach by focusing on the effects of decreasing pollinator diversity. Our global meta-analysis reveals a significant negative impact of reduced pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success measures, such as seed set, fruit set and fruit weight. Notably, this effect varies across plant families, impacting both self-incompatible and self-compatible species. We also find that wild plant species suffer more than cultivated ones. Furthermore, the loss of invertebrate, nocturnal, and wild pollinators has a more significant impact than the loss of vertebrate, diurnal, or managed pollinators. Overall, our findings consistently underscore the positive role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning, highlighting the urgency of mitigating factors that lead to the decline in pollinator species diversity.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Pollination is a critical ecosystem service for \~85% of wild flowering [@ollerton2011] and \>70% of cultivated plant species[@klein2006], including species heavily dependent on cross-pollination as well as, self-pollinating ones [@barrett1998; @barrett2003; @barrett2010a; @holsinger2000]. Many of these plant species provide valuable nutrients[@eilers2011] and play vital roles in maintaining the diversity[@cardinale2012] and stability of natural ecosystems[@cardinale2004].

In recent decades, factors such as climate change, habitat loss, or agricultural intensification have contributed to the decline of pollinator populations [@ghazoul2005; @potts2010; @hallmann2017; @powney2019; @vanklink2023], leading to a surge in scientific studies investigating the consequences of pollinator declines for ecosystem functioning [@gazzea2023; @dainese2019; @klein2003; @klein2006]. Classic studies have often used an all-or-nothing approach, comparing the fitness of plants open to pollinator visitation with those where pollinator visits are prevented [@gazzea2023; @surina2024; @lundgren2015; @lundgren2013]. This research indicates that the complete loss of pollinators detrimentally impacts plant reproductive success [@gazzea2023]. However, a complete removal scenario is unrealistic because while some pollinator species have declined [@powney2019; @hallmann2017; @vanklink2023], others thrive in altered environments [@winfree2009]. Thus, a more realistic scenario is one where some pollinator species resist but overall diversity declines.

Additionally, focusing on the role of pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success can enhance our understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships[@winfree2013]. Prior BEF research, mostly experimental and within a single trophic level[@tilman2014], has shown that biodiversity can enhance functioning via complementarity[@winfree2018; @kleijn2015] or selection effects[@fargione2007]. While selection effects occur when key species disproportionately enhance ecosystem functioning via particularly effective traits[@fründ2013], complementarity involves different species contributing uniquely, leading to greater overall performance[@martins2015; @coux2016].

Despite advances in BEF research, the nature of this relationship within plant-pollinator communities is still unclear[@hung2018; @garibaldi2013; @kleijn2015], remains biased to agricultural settings[@kleijn2015] within Europe and the US[@millard2019], and has focused on the reproductive success of crops, many of which have been modified to diminish their dependence on pollinators[@marini2015]. Contrastingly, we know much less on the relationship between pollinator species diversity and the reproductive success of wild plant species. Moreover, different measures of reproductive success can show different responses to a loss of pollinator species diversity (e.g., fruit quality can decrease more than fruit set[@klatt2014]). Finally, the impact may vary according to plant compatibility, self-incompatible species show greater pollinator-dependence thus potentially suffering more from pollinator losses[@richardson2020].

A next step should focus on revealing the universality of the relationship between pollinator species diversity and plant reproductive success across diverse geographical areas, involving both cultivated and wild plant species, as well as plant species with different self-compatibility degrees.

Here, we take that step by conducting a global meta-analysis based on data from 207 studies, including experimental and observational studies across gradients of pollinator species diversity and investigate the drivers of the observed relationships. Using multilevel meta-analytical models, we addressed the following questions: (i) How strong is the overall effect of reducing pollinator diversity on plant reproductive success? (ii) Do wild and cultivated plant species show different responses? (iii) Does the effect vary according to the climatic zone[@schleuning2012], reproductive success measures considered (e.g., fruit set, seed set or fruit weight), degree of plant compatibility or the type of pollinator excluded?

### RESULTS

#### Literature search

We performed our analysis using 780 effect sizes extracted from 207 studies. Our dataset included observations across 46 countries or regions (Fig.1), with 18.88% of the studies located in Europe (33 studies), followed by the USA (26), South Africa (20), Brazil (16), Mexico (15) and Australia (12) (Fig. 2A). Regarding the number of observations, 15.56% were done in Mexico (118), followed by the USA (11.48% , Fig. 2A). Studies were published between 1976 and 2022, with the number of publications increasing over time (Fig. 2B) reflecting that it was not until the 1990s that this issue began to be studied more intensively.

**Figure 1**. **Geographical distribution of the observations.** For each included country, the map includes the total number of observations and the proportion of observations in crops (green) or other areas (purple). Inset shows distribution of European studies for greater clarity. We show data for Hawaii, USA; the Canary Islands, Spain; the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, and the Netherlands´s Antilles as separate entities for visualization purposes.

The most frequently studied habitat type were agricultural landscapes (256 observations), followed by shrubland (205) and forest (156), with dunes, savannahs, and marshes being the least studied (Fig. 2C). Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests were by far the most studied biomes (181 observations), followed by tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests (123 observations) and deserts and xeric shrublands (121). Meanwhile, temperate conifer forests (1), mangroves (1), and tundra (4) were the least studied ones (Fig. 2D). The data analysed in these studies encompass 224 plant species from 66 families. Cactaceae (148 observations) and Ericaceae (95) are by far the most studied plant families, accounting for 19% and 12.2% respectively of all observations. The Fabaceae and Rosaceae plant families account for 9.6% and 8.6% of all observations, respectively with 75 and 67 observations (Fig. 2E). Most of the observations (81.2%) were from field exclusion experiments, with observational studies being far less common (8.2% of the observations, Fig. 2F).

#### Impacts of decreasing pollinator species diversity

First, we tested the overall effect of losing pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success. We built random effects meta-analytic models, including study identity and year of publication as random factors, and ran them with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generate model outputs for the different moderators. Using the 780 observations, our model showed that a loss in pollinator diversity had a large overall negative effect on plant reproductive success (Hedges´g =-0.83, 95% confidence intervals, CI=[-1, -0.67]; p\<0.0001, Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S3). There was significant between-study heterogeneity (Q = 38098, p-value = \<0.0001) which was largely due to between-study differences (I^2^ = 97.04%), rather than caused by sampling error. The loss of pollinator species diversity had a negative effect on plant reproductive success for both wild and cultivated plant species, although this effect was larger for the former (Fig. 3B; Hedges´g estimate for wild plants= -0.91, CI=[-1.09, -0.73] and Hedges´g estimate for cultivated plants= -0.64, CI=[-0.88, -0.4]; Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) p\<0.05; marginal R^2^=0.02).

The effect of losing pollinator diversity was different for different measures of plant reproductive success (LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^=0.09) with the greatest negative effect observed for fruit set, followed by fruit weight, and the number of seeds per fruit (Fig. 5A). This pattern was consistent across all climates and habitats studied (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5). In fact, with our data we find no evidence that the loss of pollinator species diversity had a greater impact in any specific climatic zone (LRT p=0.74; marginal R^2^=0.01) or habitat type (LRT p=0.21; marginal R^2^ =0.06). This lack of effect per biome was consistent when restricting to vertebrate pollinators (LRT p=0.27, marginal R^2^=0.03, which in this case considered all studies investigating the effect of vertebrate pollinators, including caged exclusions as well as complete exclusions of nocturnal or diurnal pollinators for plants mostly visited by vertebrate pollinators), in contraposition to previous research[@ratto2018] (Supplementary Fig. S6 A). However, tropical and desert biomes have been the subject of most of the research focusing on vertebrate pollinators (representing 51.1% of the observations). We also observed no difference between climate zones in the effect of losing pollinator species diversity for wild plant species (LRT p=0.22, marginal R2 =0.04), although the tropics had the largest effect (Hedges'g =-1.12; CI=[-1.43, -0.81]), followed by temperate zones (Hedges'g -0.97; CI=[-1.24, -0.69], Supplementary Fig. S6 B).

In terms of the type of study, the largest estimate was observed in mesocosm studies (Hedges´g estimate=-1.05), while exclusions and observational studies showed similar effect sizes (Hedges´g estimates= -0.81 and -0.79, Supplementary Fig. S7). In mesocosm studies, the experimental unit is a small-scale ecosystem, with a known and exact pollinator species. Consequently, the effects observed are likely to be more pronounced than in a real ecosystem. However, these differences between study types were not statistically significant (LRT p=0.59; marginal R^2^=0.007), and the large confidence interval of the mesocosm studies is noteworthy (CI= [-1.51, -0.58]). However, three of the five observations with the greatest negative impact on plant reproductive success occurred in experimental mesocosms where different species were introduced within boxes or meshes.

**Figure 4. Effect of pollinator diversity loss on different climatic zones**. To compare climate zones, we grouped those corresponding to temperate zones, such as mixed forests, grasslands and coniferous forests, and did the same for tropical zones, including subtropical zones. We also grouped less studied zones together as the 'other' category, which includes mangroves, tundra, marshes, and high mountains. Large points refer to the summary effect size, thicker bars around them represent the 95% confidence intervals, and the thinner bars the 95% prediction intervals. Smaller, semi-transparent points represent individual comparisons. Differences in their size refer to the weight they supply to the analysis. The vertical dashed line represents where the effect size is equal to zero (i.e. where there is no difference between control and treatment groups). *k* indicates the number of comparisons and in parentheses is the number of studies from which they are derived. Precision indicates the weight of each study, being studies with lowest SE more precise and therefore with bigger precision circles (1/SE).

As expected, we observed differences in the effect of pollinator species loss across plant families (LRT p\<0.0001, marginal R^2^=0.19). The families most affected by the loss of pollinators were Melastomaceae, Caryocaraceae, Lamiaceae, Xanthorrhoeaceae, Theaceae, and Araliaceae, while the least affected were Actinidiaceae, Stachyuraceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Heliconiaceae, and Campanulaceae (Supplementary Fig. S8). From the information extracted on the degree of self-compatibility for 50 of the 224 plant species in our dataset, our results show that the loss of pollinator species diversity affects not only self-incompatible plant species (Hedges´g -1.06) but counterintuitively, also self-compatible (Hedges´g -0.71) and partially self-compatible ones (Hedges´g -0.12, Fig. 5B). To understand this pattern, we further assessed whether all measures of plant reproductive success were equally affected for self-compatible plant species and found that in this case, a decrease in pollinator species diversity led to larger negative effects for seed set (Hedges´g estimate -1.23), followed by fruit weight (Hedges´g estimate -1.07) and finally fruit set (Hedges´g estimate -1.03; Supplementary Fig. S9).

Precision indicates the weight of each study, being studies with lowest SE more precise and therefore with bigger precision circles (1/SE).

Our results show that there were more pronounced negative effects when invertebrate species (Hedges´g=-1.38; CI=[-1.62, -1.14]) were lost compared to cases when vertebrate species were lost (Hedges´g=-0.5; CI=[-0.74, -0.26] , LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^=0.13, Fig. 6A). Studies that focused on declines in invertebrate pollinator species included a wide variety of taxonomic groups, such as Hymenoptera (particularly within the Apidae family), Diptera, or Coleoptera while those that focused on vertebrate pollinator species, primarily examined losses of bat and bird species, and to a smaller extent losses of rodents, small marsupials, monkeys, or lizards.

In contrast, when examining observations that exclude diurnal or nocturnal animals, which in most cases involve vertebrate species such as bats and hummingbirds, our results show that the exclusion of nocturnal animals had a greater negative impact (Hedges´g= -1.63, CI=[-1.9, -1.36]) on the reproductive success of plants than the exclusion of diurnal animals (Hedges´g= -0.59, CI=[-0.86, -0.31], Fig. 6B, LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^= 0.18).

We identified potential biases in the studies focusing on diurnal and nocturnal pollinators (Supplementary Fig. S10). Most studies that excluded diurnal or nocturnal pollinators focused on vertebrate pollinators (Supplementary Fig. S11). Further, while, diurnal vertebrate pollinators included birds and hummingbirds (as well as lizards and mammals) and used a wide range of plant families, studies on nocturnal vertebrate pollinators included mostly bats, and focused mainly on cacti. There is also a bias in the studies of both vertebrate and invertebrate pollinators. The plant families most extensively studied in the case of vertebrates are Cactaceae and Ericaceae, followed by Proteaceae. In the case of invertebrates, a greater diversity of plant families has been studied, with Fabaceae and Rosaceae being the most important.

Finally, we found that the loss of wild pollinator species had a greater negative impact on plant reproductive success (Hedges´g estimate -0.87, CI= [-1.03, -0.71]) compared to the loss of managed species (Hedges´g estimate -0.32, CI=[-0.52, -0.11], Fig. 6C and Supplementary Table S3, LRT p\<0.0001; marginal R^2^= 0.04). Note that studies on managed pollinators have focused on a much smaller range of plant families compared to those on wild pollinators, with Rosaceae being the most studied (Supplementary Fig. S10). For plant families with members that are both cultivated and wild plants, our results show that wild species of Fabaceae are more adversely affected by pollinator loss than their cultivated counterparts, while the opposite is true for Rosaceae (Supplementary Fig. S12 A). Furthermore, for plant families that are visited by wild and managed pollinators, only the Cucurbitaceae showed a greater reduction in reproductive success when losing managed pollinators. In contrast, for other families (Rosaceae, Ericaceae, and Fabaceae), the impact of losing wild pollinators was greater (Supplementary Fig. S12 B).

### DISCUSSION

Our meta-analysis provides robust evidence that reductions in pollinator species diversity have a large negative impact on plant reproductive success, including both cultivated and wild plant species at a global scale. Hence, the expected decline in pollinator species diversity in some areas[@potts2010; @reverté2023], could significantly affect the reproduction of various plant species.

By focusing on reductions in pollinator diversity we show that the consequences of pollinator declines are noticeable beyond a total pollinator exclusion, allowing for more realistic estimates of the consequences of pollinator declines. While a large number of studies have shown that the maintenance of optimal pollination services is critical in order to achieve high and stable crop yields [@gazzea2023; @garibaldi2013; @woodcock2019; @bishop2022], our results show that the impact of reduced pollinator species diversity had even a more negative effect on wild plants than on crops. This is likely to be attributable to the cultivation of crop varieties that are less dependent on pollinators[@marini2015] or to the different inputs used within agricultural systems which lead to lower resource limitation within cultivated plant species [@garibaldi2011; @marini2015], indicating that crops can have a compensatory capacity that implies that a pollination deficit can be compensated by the development of larger number of fruits and seeds. The utilisation of differing nutrients in crops may result in an increase in floral production and flower size, as well as increased nectar production[@marini2015; @burkle2008], which can attract pollinators[@muñoz2004], even if they are present in smaller abundances or lower diversity.

Furthermore, we found that all measures of plant reproductive success were negatively affected by the loss of pollinator species diversity, including fruit set, seed set and fruit weight. As flowers depend on conspecific pollen to reach their stigmas for fruit and seed production[@johnson2023], and given the vital role of pollinators in facilitating this transfer, we might expect both fruit set and seed set to be significantly impacted by decreasing pollinator species diversity. However, while we might expect that, in response to producing fewer fruits, plants would allocate more resources to yield larger and heavier fruits[@fang2006], our findings indicate that the weight of individual fruits is also reduced by the decline in pollinator species diversity. Nevertheless, only nine of the studies we used in our study provided information on both fruit weight and fruit set, and thus, it is unclear whether plants that produce fewer fruits also produce lighter fruits.

In the case of self-compatible plants, we expected no or small effects of losing pollinator species diversity given their selfing abilities[@sáez2022]. However, we also detected decreasing values of seed set, fruit weight and fruit set for self-compatible species, probably driven by a reduction in pollen quality when fewer pollinator species are involved, which tends to result in smaller and lighter fruits[@wietzke2018]. This may be due to the negative impact of increased pollen transfer from the same plant individual when a single generalist pollinator does most of the visits, transferring genetically identical pollen grains, and leading to the abortion of selfed zygotes[@owen2007] and therefore, to reduced seed set[@chacoff2008]. Pollinator diversity can affect the fruit quality of self-compatible plants through different mechanisms leading to efficient cross-pollination, as has been observed for self-pollinated strawberries, for example [@wietzke2018]. In any case, self-compatibility is a continuous trait that can vary even among populations of the same plant species[@baker1959; @razanajatovo2016], where the capacity for self-compatibility does not negate the potential benefits of flower visitors. The combination of outcrossing and self-pollination in these species serves as a reproductive safeguard, ensuring that self-pollination occurs only in cases where pollinators have failed to transfer pollen[@suetsugu2014].

The negative impacts of pollinator diversity loss on plant reproductive success were found to be consistent across landscapes and biomes. This is consistent with the findings of Gazzea et al., [@gazzea2023], who studied cultivated plants and did not observe any climate-related effects on the impact of total pollinator loss. However, we found no differences between biomes when observing only vertebrate pollinators, in contrast to previous findings[@ratto2018] that showed more negative effects in the tropics when losing vertebrate pollinators, although tropical areas do represent the most studied biomes in this case. This difference might arise due to differences in our study inclusion criteria.

Our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that nocturnal vertebrate pollinators have a greater impact on plant reproductive success than diurnal vertebrate pollinators, although a lot of this research has focused on a specific plant family (Cactaceae); and it is in this family in particular where nocturnal pollinators play a significant role[@munguía-rosas2009]. This finding is consistent with a previous meta-analysis on vertebrate pollinators[@ratto2018] where they found that bat-pollinated plants are more severely affected by pollinator loss than bird- or rodent-pollinated plants. Many bat-pollinated plants produce very large amounts of pollen, and at similar flower visitation rates bats can transfer up to four times as much pollen relative to that transferred by birds, making bats more effective than birds at transferring pollen between flowers adapted to bat pollination[@muchhala2007].

Our results further show that the impact of losing invertebrate pollinators was larger than that of losing vertebrate pollinators. This result emphasizes the significance of invertebrates and their role in pollination. Despite their importance, estimates of existing invertebrate pollinators are missing, but for insects in general, there are estimated to be between 6.7 and 7.3 million species, with only 1 million species described and 80% remaining to be discovered and their ecology described [@stork2018; @reverté2023]. However, it is important to note that the effect of each type of pollinator on the reproductive success of plants is dependent on the plant family being studied, a bias which is beyond our control. With regard to invertebrates, the most extensively studied families are those belonging to Rosaceae and Fabaceae, while in the case of vertebrate animals, the most studied are Cactaceae, Ericaceae and Proteaceae. Future research should investigate whether the impacts of reductions in pollinator diversity differ as a function of the generality or specialization of plant-pollinator interactions. This is however difficult to do in our present study since the degree of specialization is not reported for most plant species, and also because generalization and specialization can change through space and time [@magrach2023].

Our results demonstrate that the loss of wild pollinator diversity has a greater impact than the loss of one or two species of managed pollinators, despite their disproportionate abundance (with honeybee colonies for example hosting 60-80,000 individuals) as compared to wild pollinator species (including many solitary bee species, syrphid flies, birds or bats with lower population abundances). This suggests that beyond pollinator abundances and visit numbers, the diversity and complementarity in pollination services that a diverse wild pollinator community can provide has a greater effect on plant reproductive success. Currently, European honeybees, *Apis mellifera*, are the most important pollinators for crops worldwide, particularly for mass-flowering crops [@magrach2017; @kleijn2015; @mallinger2014]. Yet, while wild pollinators can provide complementary pollination services to plants by collecting pollen and depositing it in stigma surface in different ways [@johnson2023], showing different phenologies [@bartomeus2011; @bartomeus2013] and overall behaviours [@mallinger2014], honeybees are often less effective in pollinating some plants, leading to reduced reproductive success[@magrach2017].

Indeed, in some cases, excessive pollen on the stigmas from repeated honeybee visits can inhibit pollen tube development[@sáez2014], as there is generally a saturating relationship between pollinator visitation rate and fruit set [@sáez2014; @morris2010]. Since various pollinator species may carry pollen from different plant species on different parts of their bodies [@johnson2023], the likelihood of stigmas collapsing is reduced when pollinator diversity is high. In addition, managed species, such as honeybees, tend to visit more flowers on an individual plant before moving on to the next one, in comparison to wild visitors [@travis2023; @magrach2017]. This behaviour increases the transfer of self-pollen and inbreeding pressure[@travis2023], with the consequence that early acting inbreeding depression lowers seed set [@chacoff2008]. Moreover, a greater diversity of wild pollinators may provide redundancy, which can contribute to stability in the face of climatic or human-induced disturbances [@mallinger2014; @bartomeus2013; @winfree2008]. In a recent meta-analysis on the efficiency of honeybees in crops [@sáez2022], they found that honeybees reduce pollination limitation in self-incompatible crops, but not in self-compatible ones. Other research has shown that in self-compatible plants, seed set and seed´s germination success resulting from honey bee pollination exhibited similar fitness to that produced by self-pollination, but lower fitness than resulting from wild insect pollination [@travis2023].This finding highlights the significance of wild pollinators and underscores the importance of pollinator functional diversity for a plant reproductive success, and emphasizes, the potential risks of relying exclusively on honeybees or other managed, abundant species.

Our meta-analysis further underscores the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and extends current knowledge arising predominantly from experimental settings that link plant species diversity to biomass production [@cardinale2012] to real-world conditions and two trophic levels. Specifically, our research supports the idea that the reproductive success of plants is positively correlated with pollinator species diversity, as supported by smaller-scale studies [@fontaine2005; @albrecht2012] and observational studies [@hoehn2008]. Functional diversity is widely acknowledged as the most important component of diversity [@hoehn2008], since diverse assemblages enhance niche complementarity[@cardinale2006; @hooper2005]. Many studies have shown that reductions in the number of genes, species, and functional groups of organisms generally decrease the efficiency of whole communities in capturing biologically essential resources such as nutrients, water, light, and prey, and converting them into biomass [@cardinale2012]. For example, a diverse assemblage of bees in particular has been shown to feature a diverse set of functional traits that facilitate pollination services[@martins2015; @coux2016]. Given that other studies have shown that complementarity is one of the mechanisms by which diversity enhances ecosystem functioning [@fründ2013], it is probable that this mechanism also plays a significant role in our findings. Alternatively, a higher diversity could also favor selection effects, increasing the probability of hosting highly efficient species (e.g., [@schwartz2000]), that disproportionately enhances ecosystem functioning. However, these two options can not be tested with our analysis and both could be operating simultaneously.

While our dataset, includes a fairly representative global coverage of studies it is still subject to a number of limitations. In particular, most studies only provided information on species diversity values and no information on species abundances or visitation rates, and thus we were not able to disentangle the effect of reducing species diversity with that of reducing abundance. Additionally, it was not possible to measure and differentiate the magnitude of the decline in pollinator diversity between studies, because most articles are exclusion experiments where the number of excluded species is unknown. Therefore, future research should focus on obtaining and analyzing data on species abundances and visitation rates to control for these potentially confounding factors and better understand the impact of declining diversity.

In summary, our results demonstrate the importance of pollinator diversity for the reproductive success of plants worldwide, including both wild and cultivated plant species. The implications of these results extend beyond individual species fitness, potentially influencing community dynamics and ecosystem stability[@lanuza2018]. Our study underscores the urgency of implementing measures to mitigate pollinator diversity declines and emphasizes the need for tailored conservation efforts that should also consider the importance of a diverse pollinator community for the preservation of plant di

### **METHODOLOGY**

#### **Data Collection**

We conducted a systematic literature search using Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and EBSCO Open Dissertations platforms to identify journal articles and grey literature that focused on the effect of pollinator species diversity on plant reproductive success. Our search terms (pollinator\*  AND (abundance OR visit\* OR diversity OR effect) AND (fruit\* set OR seed\* set OR "pollination success" OR "plant\* reproduct\*" OR "plant\* fitness")) returned a total of 6,878 papers published until October 2022. We removed duplicate records as well as those that could not be accessed or interpreted.

#### **Literature Selection Process**

To meet our eligibility criteria studies needed to: (1) focus on any plant species; (2) report outcomes relating to plant reproductive success measures; (3) assess the impact of a reduction in the taxonomic/species diversity of pollinators diversity of any pollinator taxon, but not exclude pollinators entirely; (4) compare plant reproductive success in situations in which pollinator diversity differed; this included experimental manipulations where a subset of pollinators were excluded with meshes or cages or where pollinators were added (mostly managed species), as well as observational studies where pollinator diversity differed due to, for example, differences in habitat degradation; (5) be primary studies, not reviews or perspectives; (6) report means, correlation coefficients, Z scores, Student´s t, Fisher´s F value or Chi square values, studies where only the R^2^ was reported were excluded; (7) report a measure of variance (standard deviation or standard error).

We screened the titles and abstracts of publications for inclusion using the R package “metagear”[@metagear]. To be included at this stage, articles had to be meet criteria 1-5.  Following this, for the studies that we retained at the tile/abstract screening stage, we screened the full text of the articles using criteria 1-7. At the end of the screening process, a total of 207 studies were selected for data extraction.

To ensure reproducibility, we reported detailed information of the literature searches as a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [@page2021; @haddaway2022] in Supplementary Fig.S1.

**Data Extraction and Effect Size Calculation**

We obtained the following data from text, supporting information, tables and figures from the selected studies: mean, standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), sample size (N), Student´s t, Fisher´s F, X2 values and Z scores. Where results were presented graphically, we extracted the mean and variation (e.g. SD , SE) from the figures using Engauge Digitizer[@mitchell2020]. To impute the SD in cases where there were no data for SD or SE, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for the observations that reported them, and median CV. This was achieved using the following formula: CV=SD/mean. We then calculated the SD by using the product of the CV median and the sample size. We did this because excluding studies with missing variability data can lead to biased estimations of effect sizes[@kambach2020].

In addition to data on pollination impacts, we extracted the following metadata from each of the retained publications: (1) country where the study was performed, (2) year of publication, (3) biome, (4) landscape type (with a total of eight habitat types: agricultural, forest, shrubland, savannah , grassland, urban, dune and marsh), (5) the measure of plant reproductive success recorded (fruit set, fruit weight, seed set, yield, seed weight), (6) the focal plant family and species, (7) whether the decrease in pollinator species diversity was due to a pollinator exclusion, a gradient in pollinator diversity or addition, and (8) the type of pollinators excluded or added (vertebrates vs invertebrates, diurnal vs nocturnal, wild vs managed).

To estimate the effect sizes across all studies, we calculated Hedges´ g [@hedges1984; @cumming2013] using the R packages "metafor" [@viechtbauer2010; @metafor] and "esc"[@esc]. To calculate Hedges´ g, we used lower pollinator diversity treatments as treatment groups and higher pollinator diversity treatments as control groups, such that positive values of Hedges´ g indicated that lower pollinator diversity increased plant reproductive success, whereas negative values indicated the opposite that reductions in pollinator diversity reduced plant reproductive success. In total, we used a total of 780 observations of 207 studies in our meta-analytical models. To interpret Hedges´g values, we followed Cohen's guidelines, where values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 are considered to be indicative of small, medium, and large effects respectively[@brydges2019].

#### **Moderators**

**Cultivated and wild plant species.** There are large number of studies on the impact of pollinator diversity loss on crop plants. However, wild plant species have received less attention. As crop varieties that are less reliant on animal pollination are likely to be promoted, it is possible that the impact of pollinator loss will be less pronounced for these species than for wild species. Therefore, we decided to assess the impact of pollinator diversity loss on both wild plant species and crops to determine if there is a noticeable difference.

**Reproductive success measures.** The reproductive success of plants can be measured in a number of ways. However, the most commonly used measures in different studies are the number of fruits per flower (fruit set), the number of seeds per fruit (seed set) and the weight of the individual fruit. The impact of a loss in pollinator diversity varies depending on the measure being considered. Some plants may produce fewer fruits per flower or individual but invest more energy in making them larger or in the number of seeds that thrive in correctly pollinated fruits. Therefore, determining the measures of reproductive success most affected by the loss of pollinator diversity is essential.

**Plant species compatibilities.** The impact of pollinator diversity loss may vary according to plant compatibility, with self-incompatible species being more pollinator-dependent and therefore potentially suffering more from pollinator loss. In this context, this variable refers to the information extracted from TRY[@kattge2011] as (1) self-compatible species, (2) self-incompatible species and (3) partially self-compatible species.

**Pollinator type.** The type of pollinator that has disappeared will affect the reproductive success of each plant in varying degrees, depending on the plant species and its degree of specialization. Certain plants may rely more on invertebrate or vertebrate pollinators or nocturnal or diurnal pollinators. Furthermore, the increased use of managed pollinator species in crop production makes it essential to measure the impact of the absence of these managed species in order to value all wild pollinator species appropriately. Given that the managed pollinator species are typically the most abundant ones, we can evaluate and quantify the impact of their absence relative to that of wild pollinator diversity loss. Consequently, each observation was categorised according to the pollinator type that was lost or excluded. Pollinator type was only known for exclusion or mesocosm experimental studies, given that observational studies included all visitors present in the environment. For studies where the type of pollinator species lost were known, the data were categorised as follows: (1) in the case of exclusions occurring during the day, the category was designated as "diurnal, (2) in the event of exclusions occurring at night, the category was designated as "nocturnal", (3) in the case of comparisons between the absence of managed species and the addition of new managed species, the category was designated as "managed", and finally,(4) in the case of pollinators present in the environment, the category was designated as "wild."

**Biomes.** Each study site was categorised in one of the fifteen biomes based on Dinerstein et al.[@dinerstein2017] according to the coordinates reported in the study. To compare climate zones, we grouped those corresponding to temperate zones, such as mixed forests, grasslands and coniferous forests, and did the same for tropical zones, including subtropical zones. We also grouped less studied zones together as the 'other' category, which includes mangroves, tundra, marshes, and high mountains. Therefore, we performed analysis for the following biomes: deserts, temperate, tropical, Mediterranean and others.

**Study type.** Studies were classified as exclusions when pollinators were excluded by cages or meshes. When numerous plants were housed within cages and pollinator species were addedd, studies were categorised as mesocosm experiments. Finally, studies were categorised as observational when observations were conducted in the field across a gradient of pollinator diversity. Some studies about fragmentation used the distance to natural habitats as a proxy for pollinator diversity and were also categorised as observational studies. In the majority of cases, the scale of pollinator loss is not known, due to limitations in the available data and study type. It is not possible to determine the extent to which pollinator species have been affected by various types of exclusion. The extent of biodiversity loss is known only in instances where the introduction of one or two managed pollinators has been documented or in mesocosm studies where the number of species present within the boxes has been quantified and also in gradient studies where pollinator richness or diversity is measured. In light of the aforementioned considerations, two distinct pollinator diversity scenarios have been identified for the exclusion and mesocosm studies. The first scenario, designated the "control," encompasses a higher level of pollinator diversity, while the second, designated the "treatment," encompasses a lower level of pollinator diversity.

#### Multilevel Meta-Analysis Models

For a single study we often calculated multiple different effect sizes. This occurred when, for example, studies reported multiple different metrics of plant reproductive success, observations across various plant species, or explored the impact of different pollinators. Since both fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analytical models assume effect sizes to be independent, these models are not suitable to synthesize data when a single study produces multiple effect sizes. To address this non-independence, we used multi-level meta-analytical models[@nakagawa2023].

To estimate the overall effect of the loss of pollinator diversity on plant reproductive success, we first built null models containing only the different random effects. We tested these null models by combining the following terms as crossed or nested random terms: (1) unique publications identifier, (2) country where the study was carried out, (3) year of publication. We then evaluated the fit of the different random structures using Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Supplementary Table S1). The optimal random structure contained the unique publication identifier (Title) and the year of publication as crossed terms. Therefore, we built random effects meta-analytic models, where the study identity and the year of publication were included as random factors. We considered the overall effect size of lower pollinator diversity (without moderators) to be significantly different from zero if 95% of confidence intervals (CI) did not include zero.

Finally, as commonly occurs in meta-analysis, for some studies we lacked data for particular moderator variables (Supplementary Fig. S13). This meant that running a single model using effect sizes for which all moderator values were present was not possible as this resulted in very small sample sizes. In order to allow for comparisons between the importance of different moderators, we performed separate multilevel meta-analyses[@beaumelle2023] for each moderator to investigate how these factors may alter the impact of a reduction in pollinator diversity on the overall plant reproductive success. In these models we used the following moderators:  (1) the metric of reproductive success measured in the study (fruit set, fruit weight, seed set); (2) the family of the focal plant taxa; (3) whether the focal plant taxa was a cultivated plant or not; (4) whether the focal plant taxa was self-incompatible or not; (5) the biome and habitat in which the study was carried out; (6)whether lost pollinators displayed nocturnal or diurnal activity; (7) whether pollinators were vertebrates or invertebrates; and (8) whether pollinators were wild or managed.

In order to assess the impact of losing these different pollinator types, we analyzed different subsets of data that excluded either nocturnal or diurnal pollinators, vertebrates or invertebrates, and wild or managed pollinators. We built null models for each subset of excluded data and compared them with models that included moderators for the missing pollinator types.

The model coefficients and confidence intervals for each moderator level were then interpreted. Effect size heterogeneity for the simplest model (overall effect without moderators) was assessed using I^2^ and Q statistics [@hedges1984]. We used a multilevel version of index, I^2^ [@nakagawa2012] to quantify the total level of heterogeneity in our effect size ratios. We used marginal R^2^ to quantify how much heterogeneity is explained by different moderators[@nakagawa2012a].We fitted all the meta-analytic models with maximum likelihood (ML) for model comparisons with the null model, and re-ran with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to produce the model outputs that we report in the manuscript. The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) was conducted to determine whether there were significant differences between the null model and the models with moderators. Significant differences indicate the presence of differences across the levels of the moderators[@bishop2022]. These analyses were executed using the *rma.mv* function in the R package "metafor" [@viechtbauer2010]. The overall mean effect with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and predicted intervals of the models were visualised as orchard plots, using the R package, orchaRd [@nakagawa2020; @nakagawa2023a].

#### Publication Bias and Sensitivity Analysis

One form of publication bias is the 'file-drawer problem' that can affect literature synthesis because studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published [@nakagawa2012].To explore the possibility of publication bias in our dataset, we used different procedures. First, we visualized them as a funnel plot (Supplementary Fig.S2). During this we detected 9 observations with a large effect size and low precision (high SE). This was due to the absence of small studies with limited effect sizes[@nakagawa2012]. Secondly, we used Kendall´s tau Rank correlation test to check for funnel plot asymmetry, and confirmed this (Kendall´s tau -0.2424, p\<0.0001). Thus, our dataset indicates a publication bias, with a greater number of studies exhibiting high standard errors and large negative effects compared to positive ones. Third, we checked for time lag bias by including publication year as a moderator in the models and we detected a positive trend over the years, with the effect becoming 0.02 less negative each year (Supplementary Fig.S3). Subsequently, we also performed the "trim and fill" method and it showed that there were no missing studies on the right side of the funnel plot. Finally, we calculated the Rosenberg´s weighted fail-safe number, which estimates the number of non-significant, unpublished studies that would be need in the meta-analysis to nullify the overall effect[@rosenberg2005], being a quick way to estimate if publication bias is likely to be a problem for our study. The calculated weighted fail-safe number was 2 876 449, much larger than 5N+10 =3910 [@rosenberg2005], indicating the robustness of our results, regardless of some evidence of publication bias.

Due to the potential connection between publication biases and outliers, we identified unreliable observations using Cook's distance[@läuter1985]. When Cook´s distance was higher than 4/n, where n is the number of observations[@altman2016] we classified it as unreliable. We found 14 observations of 7 studies that showed high levels of influence. We compared the null models with and without these 14 outliers. As we observed that the estimates of the models were very similar whether outliers were included or not (Supplementary Table S2), we continued our analysis with these 14 observations. When multiple effect sizes are extracted from primary studies, they can differ in strength (and even in direction) across studies, but also within studies [@nakagawa2023]. To capture this variance we conducted a sensitivity analysis by clustering the effect sizes at the individual study level to construct variance-covariance matrices, which resulted in the same qualitative overall effect (Supplementary Table S2). However, we found that aggregating the effect sizes at the individual study level led to a decrease in the overall estimate (Hedges´ g = -0.57). This may be due to the large heterogeneity of effects within the same study, as there are studies with information from more than one species and different measures of reproductive success.

#### Plant Traits

In order to observe how phylogenetic traits associated with plant reproductive success might influence the observed effect size, we obtained data on plant species compatibility capacity from the TRY database[@kattge2011]. Where information for this trait was not available for plant species in TRY we used data from Lanuza et al., [@lanuza2023].
